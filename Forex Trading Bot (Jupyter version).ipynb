    "### Forex Trading Bot \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**This program is forex trading bot that works on the popular trading platform, MetaTrader 5. It was created \n",
    "using Python to connect to the MetaTrader5 terminal and run on a personal PC. It presents one of my first attempts \n",
    "at using Python for algorithmic trading and trading bot design and implementation. It is meant to showcase a sample of \n",
    "my work in algorithmic trading and trading bot development, but I wouldn't advise using it for personal trading.**\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**As described on my GitHub project page, this bot employs a variation of a SuperTrend strategy, with 18 periods and a multiplicative factor of 5, to analyze and identify market trends (up-trend and down-trend), based on which the buy and sell conditions are specified. It is designed to trade on multiple forex pairs and multiple timeframes simultaneously, currently 26 pairs in total, each having its own trading timeframe. You can add or remove a pair, or change the timeframe for any given pair. With a few tinkering, this bot can also trade on stocks and crypto, depending on the type of broker. Further, this bot is highly dynamic and responsive with multiple nested loops to control for: market open/close time, internet connection \n",
    "problems, order execution problems, high increases or decreases in account balance, among others, and adjusts its behavior accordingly. In such way it can confront and meet many different challenges automatically without intervention from the user.** \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall, the bot performs the following tasks:**\n",
    " - **Checks if the forex market is open** <br>\n",
    " - **Connects to metatrader5 terminal and logs in to personal account** <br> \n",
    " - **Checks if the internet is connected** <br>\n",
    " - **Iterates over forex pairs and collects candlesticks with open, high, low, close prices for a given pair** <br>\n",
    " - **Applies the strategy or indicator to analyze the pair's candlesticks and identify its market trends** <br>\n",
    " - **Specifies the buy and sell conditions based on the indicator's analysis** <br>\n",
    " - **Executes a buy or sell order if the conditions are met** <br>\n",
    "*It's also provided with a function that checks whether the data of a given pair was analyzed and prevents processing the same candlestick twice for a given timeframe*\n",

    "Note, before running the program, the first two cells must be executed first. The first cell installs the necessary Python libraries whilst the second imports and makes them available for use. You can run any cell by selecting it and clicking on the 'Run' icon. Please note also that for the forex bot to work, you must have the MetaTrader5 terminal installed on your computer first (*you can download it from [here](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/download)*). Upon running the code, the program will prompt you for three key inputs: your usernamer, password, and your broker's server on MetaTrader5. Feel free to try the program on demo accounts with virtual money.\n",

    "It's important to note once more that strategy being employed here is not granteed to be successful. You're highly advised \n",
    "against using it for trading. A good strategy would require careful and exhaustive backtesting first before putting \n",
    "it into use. It is only meant to showcase what I've learned about algorithmic trading and my ability to utilize Python \n",
    "for developing and implementing trading bots. If you're intending on trying it, use it on a demo account for safety.\n",
